# prtp
A simple to use and portable RTP library conforming to RFC 3550.

## Philosophy
  * Should be simple to use.
  * Should be portable to embedded micro controllers.
  * No sockets. It's your job to implement socket related functions, not RTP's.
  * No threading assumed. Whatever mechanism you might use, that is none of RTP's business.
  * No media recoding/playback mechanism assumed. That's none of RTP's business. That is yours.
  * Just conform to RFC3550! No more than that!
